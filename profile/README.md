# Sample code

This organisation has been setup for the purpose of sharing software projects. Some of the projects are available in multiple languages to allow a comparison between languages.
Use the projects to see how different elements and constructs can be created and used. You can always learn something be looking at existing code, as a professional you will need to look at, 
understand and update other's code.
